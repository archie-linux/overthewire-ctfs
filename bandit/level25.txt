- ls
- cat bandit26.sshkey
- cat /etc/passwd

User bandit26 has shell set to /usr/bin/showtext

#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

exec more ~/text.txt
exit 0

The test.txt file can be displayed immediately as the file is very short, hence more does not it to go
in command/interactive mode. However, if we make the terminal window smaller and then press 'V', more will
now be in command mode. From there we can set the shell and get the users password.

## Override user shell to bash in command mode

:set shell=/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26

level26 password -> s0773xxkk0MXfdqOfPRVr9L3jJBUOgCZ
