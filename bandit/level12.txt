### Create a temp dir in /tmp, copy the data.txt in tmp_dr, xxd to extract the actual data

- cd /tmp
- mktemp -d
- cd into the tmp dir created
- cp ~/data.txt .
- cat data.txt
- mv data.txt hexdump_data
- xxd -r hexdump_data compressed_data
- ls
- cat compressed_data | head # actual data is compressed and not readable

### Identify the type of compression used

- cat hexdump_data | head # the first bytes of the file begin with \x1F\x8B which tells us
                          # that it is a gzip compressed file

### The file is compressed multiple times with gz, bz2 and tar formats. Repeat the 
    process of decompressing until you find the decompressed file.

- mv compressed_data compressed_data.gz
- gunzip -d compressed_data
- xxd compressed_data | head # revela first few bytes as 425A which means it is compressed as bzip2
- mv compressed_data compressed_data.bz2
- bzip2 -d compressed_data.bz2
